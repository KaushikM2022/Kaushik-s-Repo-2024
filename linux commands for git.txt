cd desktop
ls                    //list all the things in desktop folder
mkdir project        // creating the folder
ls                    // now you will find the project folder 
cd project          //entering inside the folder
ls                   //now the folder is empty
git init              //initialize the empty git repository in my project folder
ls                   //now also the folder is empty as the initialized empty git repository folder is hidden but it's there 
ls -a               // -a will show all the hidden files in this case it will show the .git folder
ls .git              // to know what are all the things that are there in the .git folder
git status          // now will mentain the history of the project any change we will made in this project the git will hit up
touch names.txt  // will create the file with the name as names
git status         // how do we see what all the files have been changed,modified, added, deleted in short how do we know what are all the changes that we made in the project                    that are not currently saved in the history of the project by using this command
git add .         // now we want to know the changes should reflect in the project history
                  by using this command . means everything in the current project directory that is untracked puts all the files in the stagging area or we can write the                                individual names of the files instead of .
git status        // it's now showing in the history of the project 
git commit -m "names.txt file added"          // inorder to give the message that that changes were added in the project history we have to use this command basically -m will                                                   provide the messages of the file in the history of the project
git status       // now it will question are there any files that are not been in stagging area in this case it's no means all the files are been in the history
vi names.txt    // vi or vim filename will add something to this file let's say I have written Lingabathula Thapaswi
	       Learning the Git and Github from Kunal Kushwaha // to exit from the command mode in git bash press 'esc :wq' will write the changes to the file will save and                  quit the editor.//'esc :q!' will not save the changes or it will discard the changes made in the file and quit the editor.
                 by double clicking on the file you will see this changes been present.
            
cat names.txt // to see the changes that been made in the file we need to use this command it will display what are all the things are there in the file will show in the  gitbash                 terminal
git status     // it will show the untracked / not staged the changes that been modified as we have modified in the names.txt with the information inside it.
git add .     //now it's been staged the project history
git status     // changes been committed
git restore --staged names.txt             // staged to unstaged in the project history
git status     // changes not staged for commit
git add names.txt // again we staged in the project history
git status     // changes been commited shows green
git commit -m "names.txt file modified" // gives the messaged names.txt files modified 1 file change, 3 insertions(+)
git log       // currently all the commits that were saved names.text file added and names.text files modified
             //'q' to exit form the git log
rm -rf names.txt // this command is used to delete this file
git add .
git status
git commit -m "names.txt file deleted" 
git log // the deleted/modified file that is committed will show up in the top to delete that commit we need to copy the below hash so that all the above commits will be deleted for that we need to use the command 'git reset copyandpastebelowhashcode or first few characters of belowcommithash'
git reset  306302e3d0e4d3f82d14e9410ca0754a78a95e72 // so that deleted commit will be deleted from the project history or whatever the commit that I have been copied all the commits above it will be deleted from the project history means unstage the changes after reset.
git log // previous hashcommits were deleted
git status// it will show up like unstaged 
git add . //it will staged
git status // changes to be committed to project history
touch surname.txt//for eg. I have changed by creating a file
git add .
git status
vi surname.txt // enter the message Lingabathula Thapaswi 'esc:wq' to exit from vim
cat surname.txt// show the message in gitbash i.e: Lingabathula Thapaswi

touch houses.txt//for eg. I have changed by creating another file
git add .
git status//committed in project history



git stash //I dont want to use this changes now means goto the backstage if we want to try out with the clean code base means to put all mywork somewhere else without making a commit/history in the project whenever I want that thing back whenever I want all this things been changed I will bring you back
git status // it will show up like this On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean
git log // now my project folder is exactly like it was means the changes not been staged/committed in the project history means names.txt deleted, houses.txt added modified, surname.txt added was not been in the project history
 
git stash pop// all that are in the back stage come back to the staging area/committing means show it in the project history means names.txt deleted, houses.txt added modified, surname.txt added was been in the project history

git add . 
git status
git stash //I don't want it in the project history it comes back to the original
git stash clear // those changes that we have made to unstaged or not commits in the seperate structure were gone/removed again if we use git stash pop it wont present in the project history means we can't get those back
git status // it will show nothing to commit,working tree clean

LET'S LEARN THE GITHUB 
2 WAYS /2THINGS WE GONNA DO
1. hosting our own project on github means personal,local projects we want to push it on github/ share it with other people how do we do that?
Ans:
open the github.com open your profile/dashboard with githublog
create a new repository
give the repository name -- wish to give anyname eg. learning_git
set it to public
click on creat repository
basically in the search you will find the url for this repository https://github.com/LingabathulaThapaswi/learning_git
we want this url to be attached to our local project i.e project folder on desktop
goto git bash enter the command after entering into the project folder 
'git remote add origin url'// git is the gitcommand , remote is nothing but we are working with the urls , add basically means adding a new url, origin basically means what is the name of the url going tobe that your are going to add
//in this case git remote add origin https://github.com/LingabathulaThapaswi/learning_git.git

// by convention origin can be anything, by convention all the repositories and folders that basically in our personal/own account they have a name called origin

'git remote -v' //-v this will basically show me all the url's that are attached to the project folder // now this https://github.com/LingabathulaThapaswi/learning_git.git url is attached (push,fetch) to the project folder now // if we refresh the url in github can we see names.txt file here --NO we cant because I haven't shared the changes to this url

'git push origin master'//to share this changes to the url we use this command git is gitcommand, push means push the changes, to which url we want to push that is origin, to which branch we want to push that is master . now refresh the url in the github we see the changes names.txt was there in the url 5 commits is also here click on that you will see the on feb21,2023 you have made 5 commits with the message for the commits


what do we mean by branches?
when you click on commits you can see the master 
currently master is the main branch because of the inclusive naming convention
whenever we get started most probably we say main
my client is little old that's why it's showing master in the git bash previously it was master now it's updated to main

what are branches?
Imagine we are making commits let's create some files on gitbash 
touch hotel.txt //creating the file
git add .
git status
git commit -m "hotel.txt added'

touch rollno.txt //creating the file
git add .
git status
git commit -m "roll number.txt added'

vi rollno.txt // making the changes to this file by adding 18567T0950 'esc:wq' quit
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m "roll number.txt modified"
git log // to check the commits made below commit is the lastest commit in the remote branch (origin/master) , 4 commits have been made 'q' quit // it looks like directed asyclic graph by default the name of the branch is main previous it was master

what is the use of the branch? why are we having the branches?
The use of branch in short is whenever we are working on other feature or new feature, resolving a bug it's better to always create a seperate branch.
In branches what happens is that we should never commit on the main or master branch
because in open source projects
let's open the github and search for some project eg. react-native
we can see the main branch this is the code that is actually used by the people/users and developers
Imagine there are so many other branches but the main branch is the default branch this is the one that is been used by the people
that is the reason we never commit directly on this main branch because our code that is not finalized yet might be contain some errors
that is why all the code that is not finalized yet that we are working on should go in a seperate branch so that the users are not get affected 
for that we can create a new branch 
goto gitbash type this command for creating the new branch
'git branch feature' // we can see a new branch is been created is called as feature now  a command was executed called git checkout feature the head pointing is shifting from main to feature branch*
'git commit'
'git commit'

ls .git // in gitbash type this command to know what are there in the hidden folder .git
        //HEAD - It is a pointer that says all the new commits that we will be made will be added on the head, currently the head is on the feature branch, Hence all the commits that we will be making will be added on the feature branch. only the feature branch is moving forward and the main branch is as it is.

another point to remember we are not the only one contributing to this code base
fetch, push, branch-->master,head


let's say that while you are working on a project on your own seperate feature branch for our own issues

someone else gets there code and added in the main branch that also happens current my head is on the main branch now means whenever i make a new commit that will be added to the main branch 

'git checkout main'
'git commit' // now the main branch and your project branch is going side by side
              this is the use of branches


let's say our features that we are adding in our feature branch in our code sample that are not currently the part of the main branch means users cannot see it .
now let's say it's finalized so you will tell to the people who maintains this project my project branch code is finalized can you merge this code into the main branch/code so that the users can also use it

'git merge feature' // the people will maintain your project will merge your code by using this command
                     // now our feature branch is the part of the main branch
                     
'git checkout main' // people can actually see the code now that was on the commits to the feature branch

How this merging happens?
it happens via the pull requests

How do we create new branches?
Why do we work with new branches?
Why can't everyone work with the main branch?
how do we get the new branch merged?
what is the pull request?


if we look at our code sample right now in the gitbash 
git log // the below commit is on (origin/master) branch

git remote -v // I can open it  like this in github by select the url right click-->open it will open                it up in the browser
 
'git push origin master' //git is the gitcommand, push means to push the url, url is the origin, branch is master . if I want to push the new commits on the (origin/master) branch it will reflect the changes when you refresh the github url that you are currently working on.
'git log' // now the head is pointing to master branch
 the url that is added that is also in the origin/master branch means there are not commits above the master branch there are extra which are not already on the url

most of the qns that we need to answer right now they will be much more clearer when we are working on the open source projects/ existing project on github.

in github commclassroom/commclassroomOP
lets say that commclassroom is the organization, the project of the organization known as commclassroomOP

what do we need to do inorder to make changes/contributions to this project 
this is the project on the account of the commclassroom should anyone who doesnot have access to it like random person in the world should they be allowed to make the changes to the commclassroomOP project directly how dangerous that would be
so if we try it right now we wouldnot be able to make those changes to anyfile in this folder
